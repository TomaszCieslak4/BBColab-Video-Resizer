Since most of my courses take place in virtual classrooms, I had troubles engaging with my professor as the camera overlay was too small and unable to be resized. I created a google extension that resizes the speaker's camera overlay on BB-Collaborate which allowed me to better interact and visualize concepts being taught, rather than staring at a still powerpoint.

This google extension is unpacked and must be loaded into your <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> found in the top left of the window.
